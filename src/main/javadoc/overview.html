<p>This document is the API specification of the <strong><a href="https://calypsonet.org">Calypso Networks
    Association</a>'s reference Keypop Reader API</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Keypop Reader API</strong> should be used by the application layer in charge of setting up the reader
    management:
<ul>
    <li>It defines the interfaces and classes necessary to manage readers, reader events and card selection mechanisms.</li>
    <li>It is also used by extension modules to implement functionalities related to specific card operations and
        structures.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This API is used by the application layer that implements reader management, and to be used in conjunction with the 
    <strong>Keypop Card API</strong> also proposed by <strong>Calypso Networks Association</strong>.</p>
